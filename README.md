#HospitalRegistration-JavaSwingUIUX


## Description
It is a small program with beautiful UI to register a patient, which is sent to the server   
and it assigns a doctor, office number and shift.  
In addition, the server saves it in the database and returns it to the client to be displayed.

Note: it's created in one project using netbeans because it was part of a homework,  
I would rather had created two projects one for client and one for server

## Screenshots
I added screenshots inside the "images" folder.

## Running
```
A built version is added in "dist" folder. Make sure you already have created the database using the script.
Just run it using Java 8
